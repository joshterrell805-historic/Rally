<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The idea of the app is to provide a quick simple way to keep track of a group of friends. We need to provide some kind of way to select which friends you
want to keep track of and they need to be able to approve the decision. I was thinking something like the wow/starcraft party system. You invite people to join your
group and as long as they are in there you can find them and everyone else in the party. Somethings we might wanna think about are:</p>

<p>-Battery drain: The only problem with GPS based things are that they drain ALOT of battery if they just constatly refresh. We need to implement it in such a way that we minimize the number of times the phone gets GPS info, while still being able to easily do what it was designed to do with good accuracy.</p>

<p>-Connection issues/Communication: We will need to share the GPS info of each phone with all the other phones which could turn out to be hard to do well. Usually
crowded places where you would want to use this thing have less that optimal coverage. We would need to deisgn it so that we can share the data either on request or whenever the phone gets a chance. It would depend on how well we can do that/how much battery it takes to search for chances to communicatate and actually communicating. </p>

<p>-Look/Feel/Ease of use: I think this will be the make or break one. We can probably get it working but if its not super easy to work and kinda fun to play with I think it will be really hard to get people to pick it up. There are tons of useful tools out there that no one uses because its kinda hard to use. So we need to spend time figuring out how to make it really really easy to deal with.</p>
