<h1>Commiting Code</h1>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<h4>Git</h4>
<p>Git is our
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control">dvcs</a>
 (distributed version control system). Without a vcs, there is just one state of
 code&mdash;the current state. There is no history; there is no undoing
 to the state of the code a few days ago.</p>
<p>In git, a series of <em>commits</em> makes up the history of the code.
 A commit is essentially a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">diff</a>
 (line by line difference) between the state of the code at the time of the
 commit, and the state of the code before the commit. An alternative would be
 to take a snapshot of the entire codebase at every commit. Not only is that
 very expensive, it's unecessairy.</p>
<p>A database of commits represents the history of the project. There is the
 first commit, the second commit, ..., and the last commit. The last commit
 is known as the <em>HEAD</em> commit. The HEAD commit is the state of the
 project at this very moment in time. Whenever you <em>push</em> new commits
 to the server (upstream) you are updating the HEAD commit on the server (or
 what is the 'now' state of the project.</p>
<p>Here is where the <em>d</em> in <em>dvcs</em> comes in. Git is a
 <em>distributed</em> version control system. All the code for our project
 is termed the <em>codebase</em>. We have a git <em>repository</em> which
 versions and manages changes to our codebase. Replicas of this repository exist
 on your computer, my computer, my other computer, and the server. What makes
 git a <em>distributed</em> version control system is that you have your own
 fully functional repository. You can make commits to it, delete commits, and
 do many other things without ever being connected to the server (which has
 the <em>upstream</em> repository).
<p>When you want to share your changes with
 everyone else, you <em>push</em> your your changes the server. When
 you want to get your repository synced with what is on the server you
 <em>pull</em> the changes from the server.</p>
<h4>SSH (secure shell)</h4>
<p>On your local computer you can open up a terminal (or shell) which allows
 you to run programs to interact with the operating system. SSH is a command
 which opens up a shell on a remote computer. From this secure shell, you can
 run programs just like you can do on your local machine, but they operate
 on the remote machine instead.</p>
<h2>Machines</h2>
<h4>Server</h4>
<p>There is a repository on the server (called the upstream repository). You
 push changes to this repository so that everyone else can pull those changes.
 If you push changes to one of these hosted html files, such as this one,
 you will see the changes made on the website too! (requires page refesh) We have
 a webserver running that looks at the repository and serves the files from it.
 </p>
<h4>Local computer (ie personal laptop or desktop)</h4>
<p>This is the machine you edit code on and run the application on.
 You can edit code directly on the server, but you can't run our app on it, so
 I recommend you use a different computer as your local computer.</p>

<h2>Operations</h2>

<h4>Status</h4>
<tt>git status</tt>
<p>See the status of your repository. This will list any files you have changed
 (shown as "modified"), any new files you have made (under the "untracked"
 section).</p>
<p>Additionally, if your current branch is tracking the upstream branch,
 this command will let you know if your code is out of date. eg <tt>"master is
 behind origin/master by 2 commits"</tt>, where "origin" refers to the upstream
 server and "master" refers to the branch you are on. I'll go over branches
 somewhere else. "master" is the only branch you should be on for the time
 being.</p>
<h4>Fetch</h4>
<tt>git fetch</tt>
<p>Get the latest code from the server, but don't update the local HEAD
 commit.</p>
<h4>Pull</h4>
<tt>git pull</tt>
<p>Get the latest code fromt he server, and update the local HEAD commit.</p>
<h4>Push</h4>
<tt>git push</tt>
<p>Push your <em>commits</em> to the server. (Note: if your changes haven't been
 commited, nothing will be pushed)</p>
<h4>Add</h4>
<tt>git add &lt;filename&gt;</tt> (stage a single file)<br>
<tt>git add --all</tt> (stage all files)
<p><em>Add</em> stages a file to be commited. When you commit, all the staged
 files are added to the commit, but none of the unstaged files are added to
 it.</p>
<h4>Commit</h4>
<tt>git commit</tt>
<p>Make a commit out of the <em>staged</em> files. After running this command,
 your favorite editor should pop up (this can be configured with <tt>git
 config</tt> where you add a conceptual description of what changes you
 made.</p>
<p>The first line of the commit message is a short title for the commit; it
 should differentiate
 the commit and make it easy to find, but it doesn't need to be all inclusive
 of all the details of what was changed. The title should be less than 50
 characters.</p>
<p>The second line of the commit message is blank. The third and following lines
 of the commit message include all the details you want to provide.</p>
<p>Great commit messages take thought and time, and they are very useful.
 They're small synopsises of what was changed.</p>
<h4>Others</h4>
<p>There are many more, some of which you will need eventually, but this is
 enough for now.</p>

<h2>Workflow</h2>

<h4>Getting the latest code</h4>
<tt>git pull</tt>
<h4>Making a change to the code</h4>
<tt>git pull</tt> (get up to date)<br>
(edit code)<br>
(test code)<br>
(fix bugs in code)<br>
(test code again)<br>
(...repeat until bug-less...)<br>
<tt>git add</tt> (stage files)<br>
<tt>git commit</tt> (commit staged files)<br>
<tt>git push</tt> (push new commit to server)<br>

<p>Sometimes you may pull to get the current code, do some work, commit, and
 then try to push, but your push will be rejected because someone else pushed
 a commit between the time you pulled and the time you tried to push. In this
 case git will not allow you to push&mdash;it will require you to pull
 before you push.</p>
<p>You should run the following command if this occurs:</p>
<tt>git pull --rebase</tt> (pull all the changes from the server, and rebase
 (move) your new commit(s) on top of them)<br>
<tt>git push</tt> (try pushing the new commit to the server, again)
<p>Sometimes you may try to execute this command and it will succeed partially
 but error out saying there is a <em>merge conflict</em>. This means that
 the changes that are upstream that you just pulled conflict with the changes
 you have (eg both people edited the same line, since git does a line-by-line
 diff when making commits).</p>
<p>In this case you need to run <tt>git status</tt> to see which files have the
 merge conflicts. The files that have conflicts should be near the end of
 the listing and they will be marked as "both modified". Edit each of these
 files with your favorite text editor and search for lines that start with
 <tt>&gt;&gt;&gt;</tt>. I do this in vim by running the following command:
 <tt>/&gt;&gt;&gt;</tt>. The '/' is the search command and then you enter the
 text you want to search for.</p>
<p>These lines composed of &gt;'s and &lt;'s will surround the code that is
 conflicted. One section will be be labeled ORIGIN or UPSTREAM (not sure
 which), and the other will be labeled LOCAL or HEAD (not sure..) One section is
 distinctively "the code that was on the server" and the other is "the code
 you wrote". You need to use thinking to determine which lines should stay,
 which lines should go, and what problems may occur by removing, adding, or
 deleting certain lines out of the conflicting lines.</p>
<p>The &gt; and &lt; lines should be deleted from the file.. git just added them
 so you can tell which of the conflicting lines are from upstream and which
 lines are local.</p>
<p>After you have resolved all the conflicts, make sure to retest the
 application&mdash;especially the parts involving the conflicting areas of code.
 Merges are a prominent source of bugs.</p>
<p>Finally, run <tt>git commit</tt> to finish the merging process. Git will
 inform you that you are ahead of origin by one commit, and you should
 <tt>git push</tt>.
